# Bilateral-Teleoperation-Systems-in-the-Presence-of-Time-Delay

The main purpose of this study is to minimize the effects that changing in the transparency and stability which occur in time delay and to design control schemes that will make the system work more robustly under these effects. Kinematic and dynamic analyzes were performed for the 3-DOF manipulator and control schemes were created using these analyzes. Subsequently, studies were conducted on bilateral teleoperation architectures using these control schemes. While there were no delays in the communication channels, the systems managed to achieve ideal passivity. However, stability and good performance cannot be guaranteed when delay is added to the systems. To overcome this problem, dumping injection method has been used. In this way, bilateral teleoperations architectures showed a more robust feature under delay and remained stable. Transparency and stability analysis of the architectures were performed by using hybrid matrix and L2 stability analysis methods.
Methods were analyzed and experimented using the 3D Systems GeomagicÂ® TouchTM Haptic Device. The software used for programming and simulations for the manipulators was Matlab/ Simulink R2016a, on a Windows 7 computer system. Wolfram Mathematica 10.0 was used for mathematical manipulations.
